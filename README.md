# Image-Classification-using-CIFAR-10-dataset

The CIFAR-10 Dataset is an important image classification dataset. It consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes (airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks), with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

## Project implementer
project implemented by Nguyen Minh Quan, final year student at the Ho Chi Minh University of Science, major Data Science

## Project details
The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset available in the keras library, With a dataset with 5000 samples, I split it into 2 training sets and
validation set with rate ( 0.75, 0.25), I used the **VGG-11** model to classify images in the dataset, I use the Adam optimization method with a learning rate of 0.0001 and loss funtion is *categorical_crossentropy*

### VGG-11 Model

## The GOALS of this project are to:

Evaluate the difference between VGG model and normal CNN model


## Tools:

GPU-enabled Tensorflow

Keras API
